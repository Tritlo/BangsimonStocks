Run abati.py using python. 

Some features do not work properly on Windows, for instance the toolbar at the top of the screen with 'Home', 'Back', 'Forward', 'Pan', 'Zoom', 'Configure Subplots' and 'Save' buttons. However all features seem to work on Ubuntu. The program should be run on Linux in order to view all the features we included.

On Ubuntu a problem in the version of wxpython causes errors to appear upon quitting the program. These errors to not affect the program.

If the volume bars are shown on the graph and subplot parameters are adjusted using the 'Configure Subplots' dialog the y-axis for the 
volume bar graph, which should be short so the bars appear at the bottom of the graph, expands to the same size as the y-axis of the price plot.
